        "My internship has been an incredibly rewarding experience, both technically and personally. On the technical side, being responsible for a major backend migration project allowed me to deepen my expertise in software architecture and modern development practices. On a personal level, I was fortunate to work with a kind and supportive team who never hesitated to mentor me and help me grow. I also found it deeply motivating to contribute to a project with such meaningful impact; improving the efficiency of the electrical grid. I am grateful for the opportunity to have evolved in such an inspiring and purposeful environment."  },

      "I truly enjoyed my internship experience and the diverse exposure it provided. I had the opportunity to learn across several different domains, contributing to projects ranging from frontend and backend development to cybersecurity. Beyond the technical work, I loved the office environment. The team spirit was fantastic, and I especially enjoyed the Babyfoot games and the afterworks. It was a pleasure to work in such a dynamic and welcoming atmosphere.",
